Please include the network name, RPC url, chain id, native currency symbol, block explorer url, your chain's logo, and whether or not the chain in your issue is a testnet.

If you are a mainnet chain, please drop a link showing that koinly supports you so we can enable monetization (which allows creator fees, anyone-can-vote contests, circuits, etc).

And lastly, please @danglard somewhere in your ticket so that he can be notified when it's closed.
