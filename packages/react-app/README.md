# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start To Spin Up Locally

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork Joker Contests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanmc9/JokeDaoV2Dev.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd JokeDaoV2Dev
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd JokeDaoV2Dev
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy the contracts locally if you would like:

```bash
cd JokeDaoV2Dev
yarn deploy
```

# Development Notes
 - `yarn deploy` will not only deploy to the local hardhat chain you are running, but upon a successful deploy it will copy the generated byte code into the `react-app` package so that the app can access it. Make sure to do this before committing any changes to the contract code to make sure that the byte code that the site is deploying is the same as what you have written in the `hardhat` package!
